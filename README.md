### What I Learned💡

During the development of the Space Tourism Website, I encountered several challenges and gained valuable insights into various aspects of web development. Here are some of the key learnings:

#### Dynamic Backgrounds with React Router and Styled Components

One of the challenges I faced was dynamically changing the background image based on the page the user navigates to. I wanted to provide a visually appealing experience by adjusting the background according to each page. Here's how I tackled this challenge:

```css
const StyledAppLayout = styled.div.withConfig({
  shouldForwardProp: (prop) => "pageLocation" !== prop,
})`
  background-image: ${(props) =>
    `url("/images/${props.pageLocation}/background-${props.pageLocation}-mobile.jpg")`};

  @media screen and (min-width: 768px) {
    background-image: ${(props) =>
      `url("/images/${props.pageLocation}/background-${props.pageLocation}-tablet.jpg")`};
  }

  @media screen and (min-width: 1024px) {
    background-image: ${(props) =>
      `url("/images/${props.pageLocation}/background-${props.pageLocation}-desktop.jpg")`};
  }

  // Additional styles...
`;
```

I utilized React Router's `useLocation` hook to get the current location, extracted the page name, and passed it as a prop to my styled component. Leveraging `styled-components` allowed me to dynamically set background images based on the page, creating a seamless transition between pages.

#### React Router and Conditional Redirects

Implementing conditional redirects with React Router was crucial for ensuring a smooth user experience. For instance, when a user lands on the `/crew` route without specifying a particular crew member. To address this, I implemented conditional redirects using React Router. Here's a breakdown of the solution:

```jsx
function CrewContents() {
  const crews = jsonData.crew;
  const { name: crewName } = useParams();
  const activeName = crewName || crews[0].name;
  const currentCrew = crews.find((crew) => crew.name === activeName);

  // Redirect to the first crew member if no specific crew is selected
  if (!crewName) {
    return <Navigate to={`/crew/${crews[0].name}`} replace />;
  }

  // Redirect to a 404 page if the specified crew member is not found
  if (!currentCrew) {
    return <NotFound />;
  }

  // Rest of the component rendering
  return (
    // ...
  );
}
```

In this code snippet, I first check if `crewName` is not provided, and if so, I redirect the user to the first crew member's page. Additionally, if the specified crew member is not found in the dataset, a redirect to a custom NotFound page is implemented.

This approach ensures a seamless user experience, providing default navigation when needed and gracefully handling scenarios where a crew member is not found.
